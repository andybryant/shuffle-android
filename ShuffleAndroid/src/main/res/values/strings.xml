    <string name="help0">
Shuffle is a \"Getting Things Done\" inspired personal organization tool.
It lets you quickly enter and categorize \'actions\'. With many different views,
you can attack your actions any way you please.
\n
A simple elegant workflow encourages you to categorize your actions into projects and tags.
This structure lets you to break down formidable projects into individual achievable tasks.\n
As a project evolves, clean out old actions as they\'re performed, 
add new actions and reorder any remaining actions depending on your current priorities.
    </string>
    <string name="help1">
This is the best place to add your actions. 
The <b>Inbox</b> is where all actions start off before they are processed.
Try to regularly scan the Inbox, analyzing each action and either discard it, do it or assign it
to a project and/or one or more tags.\n
Once a project or tag is assigned to an action, it will automatically be removed from the Inbox.
    </string>
    <string name="help2">
The <b>Project</b> perspective lists all your projects, and allows you to drill-down 
into each project to view its actions. In addition to the standard adding, editing and deleting
of actions, the project view also supports rearranging actions in the order you intend to complete them.
This step is important for the Next Actions perspective.\n
For some projects it makes sense for actions to completed one after the other in strict order. For other
projects, actions can be completed in any order. This is configurable when creating or editing a project.
    </string>
    <string name="help3">
You may optionally assign one or more <b>tags</b> to each of your actions.
They can be locations, categories or whatever makes sense to you.
Shuffle comes with a few standard tags to get you started:
<i>At home</i>, <i>At  work</i>, <i>Online</i>, <i>Errands</i>, <i>Contact</i> and <i>Read</i>. \n
Feel free to modify or delete the existing, or add your own tags that suit your situation.\n
The tag view is especially useful when you\'re intending on getting something done, and need to see what
actions are applicable to your current situation. For instance, you\'re out and about in town, so you
check your Errands tag and see you need to buy an umbrella and pick up the dry cleaning on your way home.
    </string>
    <string name="help4">
<b>Next actions</b> is the best place to look to determine what the next thing this to work on is. \n
It shows the following actions\n
- those without a project\n
- the first action for sequential projects\n
- all actions for parallel projects\n
This list quickly shows you the most important actions for you to get started on now.
    </string>
    <string name="help5">
<b>Due actions</b> lets you keep track of actions you have given an explicit due date. 
There are 3 views - <i>Today</i>, <i>This Week</i> and 
<i>This Month</i> each showing actions due for the given time scale. 
Overdue actions are shown in all views.
    </string>
    <string name="help6">
A number of aspects of Shuffle are user-configurable. The <b>Settings</b> screen is available from all views via the menu. \n
<b>Calendar</b>  - Select a calendar to use when integrating actions with Google Calendar. \n
<b>Synchronize Settings</b>  - Configure a website you\'d like your data to be synchronized with. \n
<b>Backup to SD Card</b> - Save all your actions, tags and projects to your SD Card. You can them back this up to your computer. \n
<b>Restore from SD Card</b> - Restores all your data from a backup. No attempt is made to avoid duplicate actions, 
so it\'s best to restore onto a clean Shuffle instance. \n
<b>Delete completed actions</b> - Permanently delete all completed actions. \n
<b>Delete everything!</b> - Permanently delete all actions, projects and custom tags. \n
    </string>
    <string name="help7">
Some handy Shuffle features you may not know about:\n
1) In almost all views, swipe left or right to navigate between similar views.\n
2) All lists have View Settings to let you pick exactly what you want to see. For instance whether to show completed or deleted actions.\n
3) Enabled the Quick Add Bar via View Settings on any view to quickly add actions, projects and tags in place.\n
4) Hitting the Back button saves before closing.\n
5) Create shortcuts on your Home Screens for various Shuffle views and actions\n
6) Add a widget to your Home Screen to get a quick view on any list\n
7) In Global Settings &gt; Search, enable Shuffle for actions to appear in Quick Search Box queries\n

Thanks to the team behind the Tango Desktop Project, an open source collection of icons used in Shuffle.
Thanks also to David Gibb for providing some great feedback on the design, Morten Nielson for the Tracks synch work,
and to Gudrun for tolerating my nights and weekends spent tinkering with Android.\n

    <string name="help9">
<b>Custom</b> by default shows all actions. Change the view settings to whatever you want to create your own personalized view.\n
    </string>
    <string name="help10">
<b>Tickler</b> shows actions you\'ve decided to delay for whatever reason. By default it includes actions that are set to start in the future.
You can change this (via View Settings) to whatever you want. For instance, you may change it to show all inactive actions
(actions assigned to inactive projects or tags).
    </string>
    <string name="help11">
Actions, projects and tags all have active and deleted flags. Additionally, actions have a completed flag.\n
\n
All entities are <b>active</b> by default. You may wish to make an entity inactive if you don\'t intend to tackle it any time soon.
It still exists, but by default, you won\'t see it in your views.\n
\n
When you <b>delete</b> an entity, it is flagged as deleted internally and by default will not be visible in any views.
You can restore an entity by changing your View Settings to show deleted items and editing the value.
If you wish to permanently delete an entity, you can do so from the Settings menu.\n
\n
Actions pick up some of their state from the project and tags they are assigned to.
An action is considered active if its project (if any) is active and <i>at least</i> one of its tags (if any) are active.
An action is considered deleted if either it is marked as deleted or its project (if any) is deleted.
When a tag is marked as deleted its association with all actions is removed. In other words, deleting a tag will never delete an action.
